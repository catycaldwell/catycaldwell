### Hi there 👋🏿

Hello, there! I'm Caty 👋🏿

Pronouns: they/them and she/her (Preference: they/them)

I'm a Technical PM at Facebook who merges art, code, film, and text to dismantle hierarchies. For my day job, I excavate the set of developer and creator tools and services for AR/VR creators. I'm passionate about challenging our collective disillusionment around developer productivity, increasing the number of Black developers and creators, and embracing more collective futures. 

I haven't been _primarily_ coding during my day job, so I'm coming back to open source to put it back in practice.

🌱 I’m a n00b to AR/VR, but loving it thus far. I'm currently learning Unity and OpenXR. I'm also creating Spark AR Effects and world-building in Facebook Horizons.
